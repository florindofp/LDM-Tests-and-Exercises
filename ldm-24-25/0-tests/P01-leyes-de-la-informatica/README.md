# P01 - Leyes de la Inform√°tica (Laws of Informatics)

This project focuses on recreating web page layouts based on provided image targets, demonstrating the application of basic HTML structure and external CSS styling.

## Project Goal

The primary objective is to understand and apply fundamental web development concepts by:

1.  **Structuring Content with HTML:** Building the initial layout using only HTML elements like paragraphs (`<p>`) and bold text (`<b>`). The result must be similar to targets\01-leyes-informatica-sin-estilo.png
2.  **Applying External CSS:** Styling the HTML structure using an external CSS file, completely separating presentation from content. The result must be similar to targets\02-leyes-informatica-con-estilo.png

## Steps to Follow
1.  **Github repositrory:**  Ensure you unzip the folder in your git repository and push your changes before starting the project.
2.  **HTML Structure:** Create the HTML file with the required structure, ensuring it is semantically correct and follows best practices. Build the initial layout using only HTML elements like paragraphs (`<p>`) and bold text (`<b>`). The result must be similar to targets\01-leyes-informatica-sin-estilo.png
3.  **External CSS:** Create an external CSS "style.css" file to style the HTML structure. Use classes and IDs to apply styles, ensuring a clear separation between content and presentation. The result must be similar to targets\02-leyes-informatica-con-estilo.png
4.  **Testing:** Open the HTML file in a web browser to verify that the layout and styles are applied correctly. Responsive pages and good styling selectors are a plus.
5.  **Documentation:** Document the process, including any challenges faced and how they were overcome. This can be done in a README.md file or as comments within the code.
6.  **Push Changes:** Once the project is complete, push the changes to your GitHub repository.
7.  **Review:** Review the project to ensure all requirements are met and that the code is clean and well-organized.
