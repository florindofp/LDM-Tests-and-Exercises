# JavaScript Fundamentals Practice Exercises

This repository contains a set of practice exercises designed to reinforce fundamental JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and error detection. Each exercise is contained within its own HTML file and includes a `// TODO:` comment indicating the task to be completed.

## Exercises

Here's a breakdown of the exercises and the tasks you need to complete:

### 1. Change Text (`1-change-text.html`)

*   **Description:** This exercise focuses on changing the text content of a paragraph element using JavaScript.

*   **Task:**
    *   Add a second button that, when clicked, changes the text of the paragraph back to "Initial Text".

### 2. Show/Hide (`2-show-hide.html`)

*   **Description:** This exercise focuses on toggling the visibility of a `div` element.
*   **Initial State:** A button labeled "Toggle" and a `div` with the text "This is a hidden div" are displayed. Initially, the div is visible.
*   **Task:**
    *   Create a second button that, when clicked, shows the `div` again. The style to apply is `div.style.display = "block";`.

### 3. Change Background Color (`3-change-background-color.html`)

### 5. Detect Errors - Event Listener (`5-detect-errors.html`)

*   **Description:** This exercise focuses on identifying and fixing an error related to event listeners and DOM element selection.
*   **Initial State:** A button labeled "Click Me" and a title "Click Me" are displayed. The button is not working as expected.
*   **Task:**
    *   Fix the error in the JavaScript code.
    *   Add the functionality to change the title to "Clicked!" when the button is clicked.

### 6. Detect Errors - Style (`6-detect-errors-style.html`)

*   **Description:** This exercise focuses on identifying and fixing an error related to changing element styles.
*   **Initial State:** A button labeled "Change Font Size" and a paragraph with some text are displayed. The button is working, but the exercise is not finished.
*   **Task:**
    *   Add another button to set the font size of the paragraph back to 12px when clicked.

### 7. Detect Errors - Style (`7-detect-errors-style.html`)

## Requirements

1.  Open each HTML file in your web browser.
2.  Read the `// TODO:` comment within the `<script>` tag.
3.  Write the necessary JavaScript code to complete the task or fix the error.
4.  Test your solution by interacting with the elements in the browser.
5.  Create a folder in your github repository and add the solution there.

## Goal

The goal of these exercises is to practice:

*   Selecting elements from the DOM.
*   Adding event listeners to elements.
*   Modifying the content and style of elements.
*   Identifying and fixing common JavaScript errors.
*   Variable declaration and use.
